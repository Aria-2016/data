However, the industry faced challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic and semiconductor shortages, which reduced production to 1.35 million vehicles in 2021, far below pre-pandemic levels. 
                                Despite these setbacks, the sector remains vital to France’s economy, contributing 10.1% to total goods exports in 2020. Electric vehicles (EVs) play a growing role in the market. In 2021, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids accounted for 18.27% of car sales, with Renault outperforming Tesla in BEV sales by about 6,000 units. Nevertheless, internal combustion engine vehicles continued to dominate, with petrol and diesel cars making up 61.31% of sales.

Transportation remains France's largest source of CO2 emissions, contributing 126 million metric tons in 2021. The transition to zero-emissions vehicles is crucial for reducing the industry’s environmental impact.

Regional economic development is uneven, with the north being industrially and commercially advanced, while the south is primarily agricultural and economically lagging. Key economic indicators for 2023 are as follows: GDP: €2.09 trillion, fiscal deficit rate: 7.2%, unemployment rate: 7.6%. Italy has a robust real economy and is the second-largest manufacturing power in the EU after Germany.
                                    Italy holds a significant share in the global market for medium-tech consumer and investment goods, though high-tech products are relatively fewer. Major industries include: petrochemicals, automotive manufacturing, household appliances, electronic instruments, metallurgy, machinery, equipment, textiles, clothing, leather, furniture, food, beverages, tobacco, paper, publishing, printing, and construction. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are highly specialized, adaptable, and traditionally export-oriented, with strong international competitiveness in sectors such as leather, footwear, clothing, textiles, furniture, kitchenware, tiles, silk, jewelry, winemaking, machinery, marble extraction, and mechanical engineering. The service sector has grown rapidly and remains on an upward trajectory, playing a vital role in the national economy, accounting for two-thirds of GDP. Most services are related to the marketing or supply of manufactured goods. Tourism is highly developed, making Italy the fourth-largest tourist destination globally. Major tourist cities include Rome, Venice, and Florence, with around 320,000 people employed in the tourism sector.

However, Italy remains a leader in luxury and supercar manufacturing, with brands like Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Maserati experiencing significant growth. For example, Ferrari shipped over 10,000 vehicles in 2019, and Lamborghini's vehicle deliveries increased sixfold over the past decade. From 2017 to 2019, the electric vehicle market accounted for only 0.6% of the total market.

Supply chain advantage: Italy is the second-largest automotive component supplier after Germany, with over 200 component production companies covering the entire supply chain from design to vehicle production. 50% of automotive component production is exported, with extensive collaboration with global OEMs (e.g., Stellantis). Production bases: Italy has multiple automotive production bases, covering engine and battery production, with renowned companies such as Ferrari and Lamborghini.
                                    Market data: Italy produces 1 million vehicles annually, making it the third-largest automotive market in Europe. Industry development: The Italian automotive industry focuses on luxury and high-performance vehicles, with well-known brands like Ferrari and Lamborghini. In recent years, influenced by the global electrification trend, Italian automakers have ventured into the new energy vehicle market, with Fiat Chrysler Group launching several electric models. Typical company market data: In 2022, Italy produced approximately 1.5 million vehicles, a 5% year-on-year decrease. New energy vehicles accounted for about 10% of production, showing an upward trend. Sales of luxury brands like Ferrari and Lamborghini remained stable and growing.
